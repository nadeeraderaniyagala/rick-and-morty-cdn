# Rick and Morty Character Viewer

## Overview

The Rick and Morty Character Viewer is a simple web application that fetches character data from the Rick and Morty API and displays it in a visually appealing format. Users can view a list of characters along with their images and origins. Additionally, they have the option to delete characters from the list.

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd <project-directory>

3. Open the index.html file in your browser: Simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser to view the app. No server or build process is required for this setup.

## Technologies Used

- React.js: The app is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of reusable UI components and provides efficient ways to manage the application state.  


- Bootstrap: Bootstrap is a front-end framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites. It provides CSS and JavaScript components for creating layouts, forms, buttons, and other UI elements with ease.  


- JavaScript (ES6+): The app uses modern JavaScript syntax, specifically ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and above. ES6 introduced many new features and enhancements to JavaScript, such as arrow functions, template literals, destructuring assignment, and more.

## Files

- index.html: HTML file that serves as the entry point for the application.
- app.css: CSS file for styling the application components.
